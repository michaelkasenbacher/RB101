You win this game if you get to 21 without getting over 21.

Rules 

You play this game against the dealer.
Your aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without getting over 21.

At the start you and the dealer get 2 cards each. 
You can see your own cards but you can only see the dealer's first card.

You have the first turn. 
You can either 'hit' and get another card or 'stay' and wait what the dealer does. 
You can 'hit' as often as you like--as long as you stay under 22.
If you get over 21, you lose the game. 

The dealer's turn.
The dealer reveals the second card at the start of their turn. 
They have to 'hit' until the value of their cards is 17.
If the dealer gets over 21, they lose and you win.
They 'stay' if the value of the dealer's cards is between 17 and 22.

Winning the game.
You win if the dealer goes over 21.
If you and the dealer stay, the one who comes closes to 21 wins. 

Values.
The value of numbered cards is their face value.
The value of Jack, Queen, and King is 10. 
The value of an Ace is 11 or 1. The value is 11 if the value of the whole hand is under 21, but it drops to 1 if the value goes over 21 (counting the 11 of the Ace's original value).
